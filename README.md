This is a GitHub repository designed for beginner training in Git and GitHub for colleagues in DfT.

## To use 

To clone this repository into your own Git, please select the green "code" button and ensure you have selected the SSH code. You may then clone this repo as normal.

## Features

### Raising issues

The repository contains two issue templates which are loaded automatically; one for bug reporting, and one for feature suggestions. These can be used to record issues and planned improvements within your code, and the standardised template ensures you capture all of the required information every time.

### Pull requests

The repository contains a pull request template which loads automatically. This standardised form to complete ensures you are appropriately reviewing pull requests and provides a QA record of code changes.


### Gitignore

The git ignore file is set to ignore common data formats such as xlsx, csv and ods tables. It also ignores the .renviron file to allow you to store secrets such as API keys securely in your local environment.

The repository also includes Data and Output folders. Putting data inputs and outputs into these folders ensures they will not be pushed to Git, regardless of format. This is ideal when you have a project with a large number of varied inputs or outputs (e.g. XML files, or HTML outputs).
